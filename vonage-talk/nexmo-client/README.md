The Client SDK is intended to provide a ready solution for developers who want to integrate chat, voice and video into their apps.

## Installation

### [NPM](http://npmjs.com)

A dependency manager for Node packages. You can install the Client SDK with the following command:

```bash
npm install nexmo-client
```

## SDK Setup

Include the `nexmoClient.js` script in your web page

```HTML
<script src="node_modules/nexmo-client/dist/nexmoClient.js"></script>
```

Or the minified version

```HTML
<script src="node_modules/nexmo-client/dist/nexmoClient.min.js"></script>
```

## Testing

We use third party tools for testing the framework:

- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html): Karma is our test runner
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/): Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
- [Chai](http://chaijs.com/): Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.
